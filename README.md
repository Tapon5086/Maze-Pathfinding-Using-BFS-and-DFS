# 🧭 Maze Pathfinding Using BFS and DFS

This is a C-based console application that solves a user-defined maze using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** or **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. The program identifies a path (if one exists) from the **start** to the **finish** point and displays the traversal.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Pathfinding using **BFS** (Shortest Path)
- ✅ Pathfinding using **DFS** (Depth-based Exploration)
- ✅ User-defined maze input
- ✅ Console-based visualization of the maze and path
- ✅ Clean, beginner-friendly C implementation

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

### 🔹 BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Explores all neighboring nodes level-by-level
- Guarantees **shortest path** in unweighted mazes

### 🔹 DFS (Depth-First Search)
- Explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking
- May not guarantee shortest path but is faster in some cases

## 🧰 How to Compile and Run

### 🔧 Compilation (Linux/Mac)

```bash
gcc Datastructure_BFS_DFS.c -o maze_solver
./maze_solver
````

### 🪟 Compilation (Windows)

If using **MinGW** or similar:

```bash
gcc Datastructure_BFS_DFS.c -o maze_solver.exe
maze_solver.exe
```

Or run the included precompiled:

```bash
Datastructure_BFS_DFS.exe
```

## 🎮 Example Input & Output

**Input Maze (5x5):**

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 E 1
1 1 1 1 1
```

Legend:

* `1` = Wall
* `0` = Path
* `S` = Start
* `E` = End

**Output Path (BFS):**

```
S → → ↓ ↓ → E
```

**Note:** Actual output format will depend on implementation details in the C program.

## 🧪 Testing & Experimentation

You can modify the maze matrix directly in the `.c` file or extend the program to read from files or user input.
